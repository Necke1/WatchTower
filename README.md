# WatchTower
# A vigilat program monitoring against harmful messaging in the Balkan region.
WatchTower is my solo project focused on scanning messages in messaging apps to identify texts that may be interpreted as calls for terrorist attacks or financing terrorism in the Balkan region. I plan to start by developing a Serbian language model for monitoring messages on the Telegram app, as I am from Serbia myself.

The idea for this project came from observing the increasing spread of harmful content worldwide in recent years. WatchTower is my way to contribute to combating negative influences on the internet and help make the digital space safer.
